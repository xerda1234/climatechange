      <p id="Globe">Since 1880, the temperature on Earth has risen 2 degrees Fahrenheit. While at first glance, this rise in temperature is much larger then it's been in the past. The average temperature difference across the Earth over months or years has been only a fraction of a degree. Even 1 degree of temperature change can cause the balance of ecosystems to be off, which could risk extinction. Today, the rising temperatures are thought to be caused from human release of greenhouse gases, and if emissions keep going, the rise in temperatures could exceed 8 degrees, which wouldn't allow the Earth to support a large human population.</p>

      <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Ice Caps and Sea Levels<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
      <p id="Ice">The rising of Earth temperature is causing land ice to melt in the seas, causing sea levels to rise about one foot per century. Also, the oceans absorb 90% of the extra heat in the climate, causing the oceans to expand, farther rising the water levels. The rising sea levels causes erosion, which costs governments and property owners the spend billions to prevent the erision and reverse the damage the erision has already caused. The rising sea levels also threaten to flood low-lying areas and islands and destroy ecosystems, like the mangroves and wetlands that protect the coasts against storms. The melting of glaciers is also putting more freshwater in the seas, meaning less freshwater for us to drink. Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is fresh, with only 1% of that being easily accessible. The rest of the freshwater is found in glaciers and snowfields. If all of the water in the glaciers melt into the seas, then we will will have to resort to other methods of obtaining fresh water, like desalination plants, which are very costly. </p>

      <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Air Quality<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
      <p id="Air"> The warmer atmosphere increases the making of ground-level ozone, or smog. Smog irriates the lungs. Also, people with asthma are more likely to get asthma attacks, triggered from the smog. Then, smoke from fires farther degrades the air quality. Warmer air causes warmer bodies of water, which makes it easier for bacteria and other disease-causing agents to grow and contaminate drinking water. </p>

      <p id="Weather"> Climate change is also thought to be responsible for weather changes, like coastal flooding and heavier rainstorms. These weather changes and warming temperatures affects where plants grow and in the ocean causing a rapid increase of species that impact the native ocean life. In arid areas, droughts and wildfires are more common. Worldwide, there are more and more heatwaves, and increased evaporation of water causes heavier storms and hurricanes. </p>
