      <p id="Animals"> As sea ice is melting, ice dependant species have a hard time surviving. In fact, in 2008, polar bears became the first species to be added to the endangered species list because of climate change. Coral reefs are also victims of climate change. Since coral reefs are very sensitve to changes in water temperature, the rising temperatures are not helping. The algae the nourishes the coral reefs and give them their color are stressed because of the heat. The heat causes bleaching, an event where the algae leave and the coral reefs starve. Since coral reefs are home to many species, their collapse ruins the entire ecosystem. About a third of carbon emissions end up in the oceans, causing some sort of chemical changes the ends with the oceans becoming more acidic. The acidity of the oceans affects the amount of calcium in the ocean, meaning animals with calcified shells, like shellfish, might not have enough calcium to grow their shells. </p>

      <p id="Farmer"> Famers, especially on small farms, feel the effects of climate change. Farming is heavily dependent on the consistancy of the climate. Climate change is messing up these weather patterns, making it hard for farmers to keep up with the shifting weather and dicey water sources. Also, farmers are more likely to get weeds, pests, and diseases, which reduces their yield. Climate change can ruin families' livelihoods and main source of income because of their unpredicable yields. It also can hurt communities that depend on selling these farmers' products. Because of this uncertainy, food supply is threatened, which also causes food prices to go up. </p>

      <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Communities forced to relocate<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
      <p id="Communities"> Many coastal communities will be forced to relocate because of their exposure to the rising sea levels, extreme drought that would take a toll on resources, and even extreme rainfall that could become normal. Small island developing states (SIDS) are especially at risk of feeling the effects of climate change. By being forced to relocate, entire ways of life that the people of these communities have come to live by could be turned upside down and changed forever. </p>

      <p id="Tension between state and companies">Most environmental taxes are designed primarily to raise revenue, often to fund
environmental protection activities. The economic rationale behind such taxes is that
those who cause pollution should bear the costs. Such costs include both damages to
the environment and the administrative costs incurred by the authorities that regulate
polluters. To be economically efficient, environmental taxes should reflect both of
these costs.</p>
